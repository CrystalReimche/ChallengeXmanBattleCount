# ChallengeXmanBattleCount

Had two arrays that needed to be iterated over to find out which X-Men character had the most battles and fewest battles

Using a for loop, I iterated over the names array.  Within that for loop, there's an if statement checking to see if the current current number in the first index is the largest number it's seen so far.  If it is, set that number to a variable (largestNumIndex).  Also, check that first index and see if it's the smallest number that has been been and set that number to a variable (smallestNumIndex).  After the for loop has completed one complete iteration, it'll move onto the next index in the names array and start the if conditions again.
